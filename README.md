# Final project - Hotel 
#### by Alex Revchuk 

Built application usin [Svelte] and [Sapper].

Open project and get started:

```bash
npm install # or yarn!
npm run dev
```

Open up [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start clicking around.

## Structure

Sapper expects to find two directories in the root of your project —  `src` and `static`.


### src

The [src](src) directory contains the entry points for your app — `client.js`, `server.js` and (optionally) a `service-worker.js` — along with a `template.html` file and a `routes` directory.

### static

The [static](static) directory contains any static assets that should be available. These are served using [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv).
